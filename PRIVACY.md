**Teleshare Privacy Policy**

Teleshare is an open-source Telegram bot committed to user privacy and data security. Here's how we handle your data:

**1. Data Collection**: Teleshare processes information necessary for functionality, including file data, metadata, and user IDs for optional channel membership tracking. Users can opt-out by leaving the channel.

**2. File Storage**: 
   - Files are stored similarly to standard internet storage; they remain until an admin decides to delete them or due to system constraints or errors.
   - **Request for Deletion**: If you want a file removed, you need to provide the link to the file. Since the repository is open-source, you should contact the bot owner or the official Teleshare owner if you're using the bot. Reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/zawsq/Teleshare) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Zawsq).

**3. Data Sharing**: 
   - Typically, the bot provides users with a link to access shared files. These files are not private and can be accessed by anyone with the link.

**4. Security**: 
   - We use Base64 encryption of a randomly generated UUID for file links to provide a basic level of security. 

**5. Data Usage**: 
   - Data is used solely for providing the requested services. There's no tracking, profiling, or commercial use of data beyond this purpose.

**6. Opt-Out**: 
   - Users can opt-out of data collection by leaving the channel, which will prevent further use of the bot.

**7. Data Breach**: 
   - While we believe data breaches are unlikely due to the nature of public file sharing, in the rare event of a breach, we will inform users through our official Telegram channel [Teleshare HQ](https://t.me/zawshq).

**8. User Rights**: 
   - Since joining channels was optional, you can exercise control over your participation by leaving any channel you've joined. This action halts your use of the bot for that channel, but files already shared remain accessible via their links. For file deletion, you'll need to provide the link to the file.

**9. Updates**: 
   - Users will be notified of significant policy changes through the official Telegram channel.

**10. Contact Information**: 
   - For questions, feedback, or data deletion requests, contact us on [GitHub](https://github.com/zawsq/Teleshare) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Zawsq).

Teleshare operates under GPL 3.0 and adheres to Telegram's [Terms of Service](https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers).

Please remember, once a file link is shared, anyone with the link can access the file, as it's not kept private by default.
